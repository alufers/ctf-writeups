## Solutions

Just rewrite it in z3. Read [my teammate's writeup](https://haqpl.github.io/Lovely-nonces-writeup-ASIS-QUALS-CTF-2021)
for another challenge on how to rewrite chromium's `Math.random()` in z3.

But oh no! It's too slow. So we shipped our own code (and you use it exactly the
same as z3, apart from the fact that `>>` does what you expect it to do).
